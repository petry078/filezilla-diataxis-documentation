# FileZilla

FileZilla is an open-source File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server and client, that allows users to host and connect to FTP servers, from a friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
FTP servers are used to transfer files over computer networks, using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP).

The software is multiplatform. Both client and server applications are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

FileZilla provides features like groups of users, security configurations, logging and monitoring, passive mode, and NAT Traversal network connections.

It is a quick and easy way to host and connect to FTP servers without the need to code a server.
