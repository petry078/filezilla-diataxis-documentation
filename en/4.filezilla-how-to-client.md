# How to connect to an FTP server with FileZilla

To connect to an FTP server using the FileZilla Client, follow the steps below:

1. Open the FileZilla client.
1. Enter the server host, username, and password in the main horizontal menu fields. Change the port field if your server is running on a non-default port.
1. Click the `Quickconnect` button.

In this example, the server is running on localhost `127.0.0.1` with the default port for FTP `21`. Also, there is a user already configured on the server.

You should see the `Logged in` status message on the main board of the screen. 

The files in the folder available on the server will appear in the remote site section. 

Double-click, or drag, the files from the remote site to the local site to download them.

Double-click, or drag, the files from the local site to the remote site to upload them.

> **Note**: This step-by-step guide was written considering the FileZilla Client version 1.8.1 for Windows 10. The steps may vary depending on the software version and operating system used. However, the general idea is the same. Check the [official documentation](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/Documentation) if you find differences in the order or availability of elements on the screen.
