# How to create a FTP server with FileZilla

To create a FTP server with FileZilla Server, follow the steps below:

1. Start the FileZilla Server by running the `Start FileZilla Server` shortcut on Desktop and confirm the operation.
2. Confirm the operation by clicking the `Yes` button.
3. Open the **Adminstrator FileZilla Server**.
2. Click the `Connect to Server...` button.
3. Update the `Host` field with the actual IP adress of the server. Leave it as default (127.0.0.1) if you want to run a localhost server.
4. Update the `Port` field if needed.
5. Setup a password in the `Password` field.
6. Click the `OK` button.

If is the first time you ran the server, it will ask if you recognize the fingerprint provided by the server.

You should see the `Successfully connected to server <host>:<port>...` status message on the main board of the screen after those steps.

> **Tip**: In case you have some warning messages, you can always run the Network Configuration Wizard by navigating to `Server` on the top horizontal menu and click the `Networtk Configuration Wizard...`.

## Server users

In order to exchange data with the FTP server, you need to create users. To do so, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate `Server` on the top horizontal menu and click the `Configure...` option.
2. On the `Rights management` section, click the `Users` options.
3. Click the `Add` button.
4. Enter the user name.
5. On the `Authentication` dropdown menu, select `Require a password to log in` and enter the user password.
6. On the mount points section, click the `Add` button.
7. Below `Virtual path`, enter the slash `\` character.
8. Below `Native path` enter the actual folder path the user will have access to. Example: `C:\Users\<User>\Desktop\ftp-server`.
9. Click the `Apply` button to confirm changes.

In this example, all the files inside the `ftp-server` folder, will be available to exchange with the new registred user.

Follow the steps on the [FileZilla Client guide]() to test and access this server.

However, the general idea is the same. Check the official documentation if you find differences in the order or availability of elements on the screen.
