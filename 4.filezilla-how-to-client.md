# How to connect to a FTP server with FileZilla

To connect to FTP server using the FileZilla Client, follow the steps below:

2. Enter the server host, username and password, on the main horizontal menu fields. Change the port field in case your server is running on a non default port.
3. Click the `Quickconnect` button.

You should see the `TLS connection established` status message on the main board of the screen. 

The files in the folder available on the server will appear on the remote site section.
